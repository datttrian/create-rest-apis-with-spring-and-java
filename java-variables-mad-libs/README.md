# Java Variables: Mad Libs

In this project, we’ll use Java to write a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mad Libs</a> word game! Mad Libs have
short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is
usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

-   A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of
    words).
-   Words from the player to fill in those blanks.

“Roses are Red” poem example:

For this project, we have provided the story, but it will be up to you
to complete the following:

1.  Create all the variables needed for the story.
2.  Print the story with the variables in the right places.

Let’s begin!

## Mad Libs

1.

Let’s create a comment that describes the program!

The `/*` and `*/` are already in place for you. In between them, write a
description that looks something like:

``` styles_pre__Auw0S
This program generates a mad libbed story.
Author: Laura
Date: 2/19/2049
```

2.

Take a look at the variable named `story`. It is set equal to a string
that will contain our story.

All of these variables will need to be declared and initialized before
the code will compile without errors.

3.

The story that we have provided is going to need a protagonist.

Create a String called `name1` that stores the name of the main
character.

4.

You will need to provide three
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjectives</a>.

Create three Strings, `adjective1`, `adjective2`, and `adjective3` and
store different adjectives in them.

5.

You’ll also need to provide one
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">verb</a>.

Create a String called `verb1` and store a verb in it.

6.

The story also needs six <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun"
class="e14vpv2g1 gamut-xro1w8-ResetElement-Anchor-AnchorBase e1bhhzie0"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">nouns</a>.

Create six Strings, `noun1`, `noun2`, `noun3`, `noun4`, `noun5`, and
`noun6` and initialize them to your favorite nouns.

7.

Our story needs another character. Declare a String variable called
`name2` and initialize it to the value of another name.

8.

Our story requires one number. Declare an `int` variable called `number`
and set it to any whole number you like.

9.

There’s one more variable! Declare a String called `place1` and store
any place in it. This could be a city, or a town, or a country, or a
planet!

10.

Alright! It seems like we have all the variables we need. Save the file
to see it run. Does it compile without errors?

11.

Time to read the story! Use `System.out.println()` to print the `story`
variable.

12.

Put some whitespace in your code so that the `story` variable is hidden,
and show your friends the code. Have someone else fill in the variables
you have declared with the nouns, adjectives, verbs, and names that they
like.

Then, run the code to see a new story get told!
